# Branding Assets

This directory contains branding assets for the Route 66 Trip Planner.

## Required Files

## Usage

The logo should be:
- High resolution (at least 200px height for PDF quality)
- PNG format with transparent background preferred
- Optimized for web use

## Implementation

The logo is used in:
- PDF export headers (`PDFLogo.tsx` component)
- Other branding contexts as needed

Make sure to place the `ramble66-logo.png` file in this directory for the PDF functionality to work properly.
