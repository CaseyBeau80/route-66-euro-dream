# Route 66 Google Maps Implementation

## API Key Information

The Google Maps API key has been implemented in the application. If you need to change or update the API key in the future, you can find it in:

`src/components/Route66Map/GoogleMapsRoute66.tsx`

### API Key Security

For production deployment, consider:
- Adding API key restrictions in the Google Cloud Console
  - Restrict to specific HTTP referrers (your domain)
  - Restrict to specific IP addresses if applicable
  - Enable only the specific Maps APIs you need
- Using environment variables to store your API key
- Implementing a backend proxy to handle requests to Google Maps API

### Troubleshooting

If the map fails to load:
1. Check that the API key is valid and active
2. Ensure the Maps JavaScript API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console
3. Check for any billing issues if applicable
4. Verify there are no browser console errors related to the API key
